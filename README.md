# TuringTech Technical Test / Backend API (Beginner -> Intermediate)

This problem can be divided into five steps

1. Start the server and successfully fetch data from any github api
2. Find/Identify the API/s that cater the requirements
3. Save the data into mongoDB
4. process the data to get the required result 
5. cater all the cases required other than sending the data (error handling etc)

1... for step 1 currently using HTTPs to fetch the api data, apis are working fine but no significant way to do this without using nested loops...
1... will find a way to make axios work... first focus is getting the task done... to reduce the complexity and cost of making the api call of commits, will use mongoDb to store some data for future reference.
